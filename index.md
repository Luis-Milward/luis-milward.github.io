## Lab 5 Part 2

    This lab opened my mind on how to approach coding by thinking about every possible solution while coding. This is from creating conversions from feet into inches. It also challenged me into the concepts of floats. Something I gained from this lab is the confidence to explore different approaches to code.

## Lab 6 Part 2

    This lab was one of the harder labs for me for the school year. Coding Blackjack was hard by not only understanding the rules of blackjack. Also to convert that knowledge into also implementing the rules into the game. A skill I gained from this lab was the ability to code into a deeper level than I did before.

## Lab 1 Part 1

    Doing my first ever lab of Hello World opened my eyes and had me in shock of the potential I have from not coding prior to attending college. Also another thing that shocked me is the ability to understand code with ease. One thing this lab did for me is to open my eyes to the possibilities I have in the future.
